# Lung Cancer Data - DSA210 Project - Spring 2025

## Project Overview
This project will be about investigating how data can be used to determine a patient's lung cancer status based on important medical signs. The goal is to find the most crucial elements that go into a diagnosis by looking for trends in patient data. Understanding which characteristics—such as demographics, mental difficulties, or chronic diseases—are most predictive and how a data-driven strategy might support early detection are the main goals of this study.

The strategy is simple: collect and examine relevant data, create a model to predict the risk of lung cancer using Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.), and assess its performance. Beyond mere forecasting, This project aims to find information that can aid in improving diagnostic methods and demonstrate how data science can be used in medical decision-making.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Predictive Model:** Build and evaluate a machine learning model to estimate whether a patient has lung cancer based on the current patient data.
2. **Feature Selection and Importance Analysis:** Identify the most significant features that contribute to lung cancer prediction.
3. **Compare Machine Learning Algorithms:** Experiment with different classification models to determine the most effective approach for accurate diagnosis.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure reliability in classification.
5. **Dataset Comparison:** Analyze and compare the two datasets using the similar columns of informations.
6. **Getting Valuable Results:** Create models using the two datasets and predict if a patient has a cancer or not.

## Datasets to Use

The first dataset that will be used in this project is a publicly available dataset taken from Kaggle. There are 15 columns of information contained.
The second dataset is also a publicly available dataset taken from Kaggle. There are 20 columns of information contained.

## Conclusion

This project aims to use data science to improve lung cancer diagnosis by identifying key predictive factors and building a reliable machine learning model. By analyzing patient data, I hope to uncover insights that support early detection and better medical decision-making. The findings could contribute to advancing approaches that use data science in healthcare and further improving diagnostic accuracy.
